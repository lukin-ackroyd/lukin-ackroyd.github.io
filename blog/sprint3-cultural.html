    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is the understanding of social scenarios, your own emotions and empathy. Essentially, it’s being self-aware as much as it is being able to read the room.</p>
    <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
    <p>IQ is a measurement of one’s ability to problem solve using their own intelligence and reasoning ability. The focus of an IQ test is around ability to solve puzzles or their memory. EQ however is focused towards one’s ability to work within a group, get the best out of themselves and others. To be fair IQ models are not even well regarded in comparison to EQ models. A good example would be Stephen Hawking’s response to someone asking his IQ:</p>
    <p><strong margin="30px">"I have no idea. People who boast about their IQ are losers." – Stephen Hawking</strong></p>
    <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
    <p>Honestly EQ is extremely important for several reasons. The main one is people with high levels of EQ will generally be happier and more relaxed. This is mainly due to their understandings of their own mind and limitations. You’ll find that being able to understand how to control your emotions will save you from many sticky situations!</p>
    <p>EQ will provide someone with more influence in a group of people and generally those with very high EQ will be in leadership positions. A well-known fact is that the smartest man in the room is rarely the person in charge but the most charismatic will usually be in this position. </p>
    <p>During my time in recruitment I worked with one of Australia’s largest Super Funds who had recently acquired a large billion-dollar entity. One of the key things we tested and measured for when hiring for their executive leadership team was EQ.</p>
