        <p>Today we will discover together what the differences are between Margins, Borders and Padding! This can be created in CSS to add some emphasis to your content. Rather than make this too complicated we can explain the differences and display them simply with the image below and break it down!</p>
        <div class="example3" style="margin:auto">
          <div class="example2" style="margin:auto">

        <h3>The Margin</h3>
        <p>Lets start with the outermost part! As you can see from my amazing photo I took from one of my last hiking adventures, I have decided to create a more visual representation of a margin. A margin is essentially the black area. This would be transparent and clears an area outside the border to seperate the border from external elements.</p>
        <h3>The Border</h3>
        <p>The border is signified in our picture by the light brown colour which crates a space in between both the margin and the padding this would frame the content</p>
        <h3>The Padding</h3>
        <p>The padding is shown here in white. This would be transparent space between both the border and the content essentially creating room for content to shine.</p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p class="example4" style="margin:auto">Ultimately the difference between each of these spaces is more about the effect they have on the overall content. You can see here I have a Brown Border to box off the text with a space between the border and the words. The beauty is the fact that margin, borders and padding can really work together to have a profound effect on the way you view something and can draw you in to the point they are making.</p>
