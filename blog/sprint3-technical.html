        <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>An easy way to describe the differences between HTML and CSS is HTML is a bit like my Home but in more detail it is the structure of my home. The walls, rooms windows and layout. CSS is like my decorating! CSS is me expanding upon my framework and structure and breathing life in to my home. CSS is my wallpaper, painting and carpet and really the personality.</p>
        <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
        <p>Washing the dishes is a very boring but necessary control flow and loop which I perform. The control is a simple expression that <strong>IF aPlate is dirty</strong> then I will clean the plate the looping part is that generally I am not lucky enough to have just one plate to clean so I will then continue the loop process of washing plates until I have met the criteria that no plates are available to wash.</p>
        <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
        <p>Ok so we know HTML is the structure and guts of things and we know CSS makes it look pretty but I can hear you asking! Who the heck is DOM? Not short for Dominic the DOM stands for <strong>Document Object Model</strong> (in fact a pretty basic one of these is in the image below) it’s like a family tree. It basically ties together HTML and CSS with the use of JavaScript! In our technical work we were utilizing the HTML and CSS to verify that upon certain actions where we interact with various div classes (Clicking, Right Clicking and Double clicking) in the HTML to trigger a response and change using CSS (Colour or Visibility).</p>

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable! As an example I have 2 children I could put them in an array together with would be:</p>
        <p>var children = [“Ezra”, “Arlo”]</p>
        <p>This is a simple way of being able to list some elements. Next thing is to look at an object and this quite simply put a great way to expand upon an object and provide a chance to add some detail about it:</p>
        <p>var arlo = {Loves:”Eating mud”, age:”1”, smells:”definitely bad”};</p>
        <p>as you can see I can now use the information in this object to make a code where I could ask javascript to display Arlo’s favourite things or his age or whether he smells (This was written fresh off the back of a dirty nappy.</p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
        <p>A function is a basically a way of grouping a set of instructions in to a single command. Calling back to my example of washing dishes. I will have to perform this function multiple times so rather than write out the set of instructions over and over again I can just make a function called “washDishes” then IF aPlate is dirty I will washDishes until I have met the criteria that the dish is clean.</p>
