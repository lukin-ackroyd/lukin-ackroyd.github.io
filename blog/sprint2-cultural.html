      <h3>The Goal</h3>
      <p>My long-term goal and career are really anything within coding. I think long term I would like to branch out into some more languages and look more at application development. Really for me it’s about learning more and more. Knowledge is truly power; I find it amazing how many things you can learn daily. That’s what I love about coding and as a person with a <a href="https://www.robinsharma.com/mastery-sessions/the-5-mentalities-of-mastery">lunchbox mentality</a> this drives me, I get excited about what I will learn every day and want to continue that growth in my career. For now, I will be working to a Full Stack Developer role.</p>
      <h3>Where can I grow?</h3>
      <p>Now I really think I could delve a bit deeper into myself and my strengths and build structure around the way I work to the best of my abilities. Some of my strengths are really within teamwork and working with groups. I think I have built a lot of emotional maturity in my time with work and personal life because some of the challenges I have faced have forced me to relax more.</p>
      <h3>My Commitment!</h3>
      <p>I am committing myself to ensure that I am methodical with my planning and time blocking in order to attain the results I so badly want to achieve! This is included by improving my use of Toggl and planning my work week in advance as I do have family commitments to my wife and kids. An important part is for me not to rush to make use of all the time available to me to look back on what I have done, plan and properly execute on work moving forwards.</p>
