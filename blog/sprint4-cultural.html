    <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is pretty amazing in fact studies have shown amazing things as a result of Neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is essentially the understanding that the brain has principles making it very 
        similar to a muscle in which you can strengthen certain areas of your brain through rigorous practice and repetitive functions. This can actually apply to absolutely any skill. In fact Neuroplasticity is 
        so prevalent we can see how it has affected people in many different ways. As an example blind people have shown that they have increased function and activity in parts of the brain that utilize the nerve 
        endings in your hand. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is all this a benefit you may wonder? Because simply put. Age doesn’t matter, disabilities do not matter and neither does your perceived intelligence matter. What matters is that you can do anything you 
        want if you are willing to put in effort to challenge your brain in new areas and rigidly study or practice these skills. What you are essentially doing is opening new parts of your brain and driving activity 
        that can make you “Smarter” in whatever you are wanting to learn.
      </p>
    <h3>How might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve looked at Neuroplasticity and similar ideologies about the brain before and one of the things I really enjoy about it and how it benefits me is just knowing what it is and what it means. To me it means 
        “I will get it” and to expand on that how I will get it “through practice and not being afraid to fail”. Slap that together and you have a motto for learning “I will get it! Through practice and not being 
        afraid to fail!”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expanding upon this a great deal of research in science has been put around this the satisfaction of “Getting it” is well known as the Eureka! (or Aha!) moment. When those neurons all click and fire together 
        giving you the proverbial warm fuzzies of learning!
      </p>
    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>
        Practice, practice, practice! Whatever skill it is practice it. Meditate upon it and make it part of your daily life. To truly master something this will always be a golden rule! I am a big fan as well of 
        general brain training. Make a point of doing puzzles for fun. Make a point to challenge your brain daily but don’t forget just because “You don’t get it…” now does not mean “You will never get it” you always 
        can and always will with practice.

    <h3>Growth Mindset, what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset, lunchbox mentality, high performance mindset. These are lots of different techniques to describe one obvious thing. Push yourself out of your comfort zone and be hungry to learn. To underplay these 
        simple but extremely effective techniques is detrimental to advancing your career and aspirations. Following growth mindset not just in the pursuit of knowledge but all endeavors will allow you to feel more 
        fulfilled in life and happier.
      </p>
    <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        Not particularly as I really submit to the power of a growth mindset and have for a long time with research into a number of different pieces of information including that of Carol Dweck who originally coined the 
        idea of a Fixed v Growth Mindset.
      </p>
    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I already do and how do I do it? Failure is not an option. Learning always is. I really don’t believe I will just never get something. Am I faster than everyone? Maybe not. Am I smarter than everyone? Maybe not. 
        But neither of this mean success. The difference is how much you want it and how much effort you are willing to put in. How willing you are to tack a new challenge and say “Yeah I will get this”
