        <h2>The Simple one</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
          <p>
            The simple problem was that I had wrote some very long and over the top code that I knew while it may have been doing the job was not exactly what I needed. 
          </p>
        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          <p>
            First thing I did was look at the pseudocode I had wrote. Main thing though was that the pseudocode was accurate to what I needed it to achieve but was still too overcomplicated. 
            Pseudocode is basically what you want the JavaScript to achieve. Then I did the rubber ducky which is basically explaining what I wanted to an inanimate object, I even went as far as 
            writing down what I needed in a rough equation. Did some quick googling of different ways I could apply the code and was ultimately able to make the code manageable and clean! 
            I reached out to my facilitator but pretty much understood as soon as I messaged her.
          </p>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          <p>
            Pretty calm. I mean I was curious as to how I made such a complicated mess but I was focused on making something that worked before you make it pretty.
          </p>
        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
          <p>Exactly that! Make it work before you make it pretty and draw it like a machine. That worked wonders for me having something visual to work with.</p>
        <h2>The Elegant Solution</h2>
        <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
          <p>
            I was really struggling to work out a nice way to write out what whereAreYou needed to work. It was more of a connection issue in my brain, but It just wasn’t passing. 
          </p>
        <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
          <p>
            Pseudocode and drawing things out and then walking through them out loud worked so well for me just to force me to take the time to work it out and really know what I needed 
            from the process. Then when I went back to writing it I felt more confident. A quick google of similar functions other people had put back together armed with the knowledge of 
            what I need really helped!
          </p>
        <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
          <p>
            Annoyed that I wasn’t getting it. But by the end it was an overwhelming sense of achievement. The struggle made me feel like I really learnt something.
          </p>
        <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
          <p>
            Main thing I learnt was a better understanding of how a function worked using arrays and not to let myself get too annoyed and walk away from something and reassess.
