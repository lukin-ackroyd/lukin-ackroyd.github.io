    <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes other people just have a better way of doing something. It doesn’t even mean I am bad at it or they are better just that there is so many ways to do things that we all have 
        the different perspectives.
      </p>
    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
      <p>
        I think it just adds to being able to do your best work not just with others but by yourself. You are kinder to yourself and more aware of limitations and when in a group of others.
      </p>
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Just how useful I would find a lot of it. I really wasn’t convinced coming in to it but now I am.
      </p>
    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Just being open with myself and being aware that I was learning something from scratch again and drop the fact I had studied computer science in the past and that my ego wasn’t important.
      </p>
    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>
        I think you just want to prepare us to learn and find information really well and be relatable in a group. It definitely will go a long way in the future when working.
      </p>
    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
      <p>
        Not really. I am using some of the techniques to help my wife in her learning journey and some of the tools are amazing. I think teaching people to learn and understand themselves only adds
        to your ability to be a good student and hungry for knowledge.
      </p>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I really want to be involved in a lot of different technology but most of all I want a job where I am making something new and stretching my skills and still learning more. Career pathway at this point is 
        anything in the technology world as I am still so fresh. What I know is I want to learn more outside web development.
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        Strengths will be that I learn fast and I enjoy this genuinely, so it gives me a huge boost doing it. I get a real thrill out of carving my own path. My limitations will be being a Dad two very small kids 
        and working from home. It’s always hard.
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
        Making time for Family and study. Staying on top of what I need to do will be critical.
      </p>
    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
      <p>
        Working with people in a more technical way and being patient with them. I have a habit to just do something if I know how to do it rather than let someone else have a go.
      </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        To complete it and be very comfortable coding by the end of it.
