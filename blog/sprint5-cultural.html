    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        I really want to be involved in a lot of different technology but most of all I want a job where I am making something new and stretching my skills and still learning more. Career pathway at this point is 
        anything in the technology world as I am still so fresh. What I know is I want to learn more outside web development.
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
        Strengths will be that I learn fast and I enjoy this genuinely, so it gives me a huge boost doing it. I get a real thrill out of carving my own path. My limitations will be being a Dad two very small kids 
        and working from home. Itâ€™s always hard.
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>
        Making time for Family and study. Staying on top of what I need to do will be critical.
      </p>
    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
      <p>
        Working with people in a more technical way and being patient with them. I have a habit to just do something if I know how to do it rather than let someone else have a go.
      </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        To complete it and be very comfortable coding by the end of it.
