            <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took?</h2>
            <p>Ethical issues were common with the work I was doing previously. I am very passionate about the effects of climate change and the environment at large and really believe that the damage done by a lot of businesses outweighs the positive effects they suggest they may have economically or otherwise. 
                This meant there were a few companies that I chose not to work with as their views on human rights, plastic waste or effects on the environment didn’t align with my own. This meant I missed out on some rather lucrative opportunities, but it would be hypocritical not to stand by my belief.</p>
            <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?</h2>
            <p>I suppose my culture has had a deep impact on my values and identity. This is mostly due in part to my upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness and being born in a country which is not the same as where my parents grew up. In England I was always the Kiwi kid and then when I first moved to New Zealand I was the English kid. 
                The main thing is my values really shape the people that I have chosen to have in my life. Those values are:
                Honesty not just because I don't like being lied to but also because I need people who can be honest about areas I can improve and people who want to see me grow. People who won't just say what I want to hear but are prepared to challenge my thinking.
                Respect I won't always make the right decisions or decisions/choices people like in life but all I want is to live in a world where people can respect one another for whatever we want to believe and who we want to be.
                Equality It doesn't matter to me your gender, race or beliefs I think everyone from any background deserves the same basic rights as anyone. I grew up with a lot of stigmas and to be rid of them is a huge breath of fresh air. (I could write all day about this subject...)

            <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development?</h2>
            <p>In my last job I did a Myers Briggs strengths assessment. Unfortunately I no longer have the assessment available (Despite some digging) Essentially my strengths are in leadership, planning and execution. I am very methodical in my approach but like to take things my own way and work off of my personal experience. </p>
            <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles?</h2>
            <p>I definitely believe the planning side of things will be the key to most things with learning obstacles. I take my time to work out how I’m digesting information and put it in to practice. Execution is also key as I don’t hesitate and work quickly.</p>
            <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why?</h2>
            <p>I play a lot of online games. I used to struggle to get my voice across and would watch us make the same mistakes and be quite vocal. I realized rather than being aggressive about my vocalization you get better results from having a discussion and listening to other people whilst putting your point across.</p>
